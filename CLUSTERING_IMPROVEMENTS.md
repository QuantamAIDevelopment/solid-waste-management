# Clustering Improvements

## Overview
Enhanced the garbage collection route clustering system to ensure all houses assigned to a cluster are located within that cluster's geographic zone.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Geographic Zone Enforcement
- **Problem**: Previous clustering could assign houses to clusters where they were geographically distant from the cluster's main area
- **Solution**: Created `ImprovedClustering` class that enforces geographic constraints using convex hulls

### 2. Four-Step Clustering Process

#### Step 1: Initial Spatial Clustering
- Uses K-means clustering on house locations
- Assigns roads to clusters based on house votes

#### Step 2: Geographic Zone Creation  
- Creates convex hull zones for each cluster
- Adds 50m buffer to include nearby houses

#### Step 3: Constraint Enforcement
- Identifies houses outside their assigned cluster's zone
- Reassigns violating roads to geographically appropriate clusters
- Ensures all houses are within their cluster's geographic boundaries

#### Step 4: Load Balancing
- Balances cluster sizes while maintaining geographic constraints
- Moves boundary roads between oversized and undersized clusters

### 3. Integration
- Updated both `RouteAssignmentAgent` and `RouteAssignmentAgentFixed` to use improved clustering
- Maintains backward compatibility with fallback mechanisms

## Files Modified

1. **`tools/improved_clustering.py`** - New clustering implementation
2. **`agents/route_assignment_agent.py`** - Updated to use improved clustering  
3. **`agents/route_assignment_agent_fixed.py`** - Updated to use improved clustering
4. **`tests/test_improved_clustering.py`** - Basic functionality test
5. **`tests/test_geographic_constraints.py`** - Geographic constraint validation test

## Test Results

- ✅ All houses are within their cluster's geographic zones (0 violations)
- ✅ Integration tests pass with existing system
- ✅ Maintains non-overlapping route requirements
- ✅ Preserves load balancing across vehicles

## Benefits

1. **Geographic Coherence**: Routes are now geographically compact and logical
2. **Reduced Travel Time**: Vehicles don't need to traverse long distances between scattered houses
3. **Operational Efficiency**: Easier route execution with clear geographic boundaries
4. **Scalability**: Works with any number of vehicles and maintains performance
5. **Robustness**: Includes fallback mechanisms for edge cases

## Usage

The improved clustering is automatically used when processing route assignments:

```python
from tools.improved_clustering import ImprovedClustering

clustering = ImprovedClustering(random_seed=42)
clusters = clustering.create_geographic_clusters(roads, houses, n_vehicles)
```

The system ensures that every house assigned to a cluster is geographically located within that cluster's zone, eliminating spatial inconsistencies in route assignments.
